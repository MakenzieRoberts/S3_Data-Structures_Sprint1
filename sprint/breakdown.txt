user needs to access and provide secret information

Ee need (at least) two endpoints:
	One that allows users to send a request to a “file” and store a message, 
	and another that allows the user to retrieve a previously stored message from a file.

Critically, when a message is retrieved, it should be removed from circulation so that it cannot be retrieved again

We’re going to provide two versions of these end points, one that works like a stack, and one that works like a queue. (So 4 endpoints in total...)

{

data: “Data Here”,

AgentId: “SomeNumberHere”,

StructureId: “SomeNumberHere”

}
